\title{Compare barcodes between raw and filtered data}
\usage{
compareBarcodes(
  from_resource,
  to_resource,
  spacerangerOut,
  processing = c("raw", "filtered"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{from_resource}{\code{character(1)} The path to the resource file whose
barcodes are used as the basis of the comparison; typically, the "raw"
feature barcodes are used.}

\item{to_resource}{\code{character(1)} The path to the resource file whose
barcodes are compared to the \code{from_resource}; typically, the "filtered"
feature barcodes.}

\item{spacerangerOut}{\code{character(1)} A scalar vector specifying the path
to the \verb{space ranger} output directory.}

\item{processing}{\code{character(2)} A vector of length 2 that corresponds to the
processing type. The processing types are typically "raw" and "filtered".
These are the prefixes of the folder names \code{raw_feature_bc_matrix} and
\code{filtered_feature_bc_matrix}. The order of the vector determines the
comparison. By default, \code{processing = c("raw", "filtered")}, which means
barcodes in the raw data are compared to the filtered data.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with barcodes of the first element in the \code{processing}
data type as the first column and a logical vector indicating whether the
barcodes are found in the second element in \code{processing}. For example,
if processing is \code{c("raw", "filtered")}, then the first column will be the
barcodes in the \code{raw} data and the second column will be a logical vector
indicating whether the barcodes are found in the \code{filtered} data.
}
\description{
This function compares the barcodes between raw and filtered
data \strong{depending} on the order of \code{processing}. Typically, the "raw"
barcodes are compared to the "filtered" ones. The presence of raw
barcodes in the filtered data are marked as \code{TRUE} in the resulting
\code{data.frame}.
