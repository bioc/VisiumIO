\title{A class to represent and import spatial Visium data}
\usage{
TENxSpatialList(
  resources,
  sample_id = "sample01",
  images = c("lowres", "hires", "detected", "aligned"),
  jsonFile = .SCALE_JSON_FILE,
  tissuePattern = "tissue_positions.*\\\\.csv"
)

\S4method{import}{TENxSpatialList,ANY,ANY}(con, format, text, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{resources}{A \link{TENxFileList} object or a file path to the tarball
containing the matrix / assay data resources.}

\item{sample_id}{\code{character(1)} A single string specifying the sample ID.}

\item{images}{\code{character()} A vector specifying the images to be imported;
can be one or multiple of "lowres", "hires", "detected", "aligned".}

\item{jsonFile}{\code{character(1)} A single string specifying the name of the
JSON file containing the scale factors.}

\item{tissuePattern}{\code{character(1)} A single string specifying the pattern
to match the tissue positions file.}

\item{con}{The connection from which data is loaded or to which data is
saved. If this is a \code{character} vector, it is assumed to be a file name and
a corresponding file connection is created and then closed after exporting
the object. If it is a \linkS4class{BiocFile} derivative, the data is loaded from
or saved to the underlying resource. If missing, the function will return
the output as a character vector, rather than writing to a connection.}

\item{format}{The format of the output. If missing and \code{con} is a
file name, the format is derived from the file extension. This argument is
unnecessary when \code{con} is a derivative of \linkS4class{BiocFile}.}

\item{text}{If \code{con} is missing, this can be a character vector directly
providing the string data to import.}

\item{...}{Parameters to pass to the format-specific method.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatialExperiment} object
}
\description{
This class is a composed class of \link{TENxFileList}, which can
contain a list of \link{TENxFile} objects, and a \link{TENxSpatialList} object. It is
meant to handle spatial Visium data from 10X Genomics.
}
\details{
Typically, the user will not create an object of this class directly
but rather use the \code{\link[=TENxVisium]{TENxVisium()}} constructor function to create an object
of this class.
